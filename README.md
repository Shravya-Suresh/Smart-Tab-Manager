As developers, we often keep many browser tabs open for references, documentation, or tools. Over time, this becomes overwhelming, and we may forget or feel lazy about closing tabs that are no longer needed.

Smart Tab Manager is a Google Chrome extension designed to help manage browser tabs automatically. It monitors user activity — including keyboard presses, mouse clicks, and scroll behavior — and evaluates which tabs are actively used and which are idle.

The extension then recommends tabs to close by showing an intuitive popup, helping users keep their browser clean and focused, without losing important references. Tabs that have no activity (no scrolling, clicking, or typing) are considered less important and suggested for closure.
